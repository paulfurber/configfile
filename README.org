* ConfigFile

This is ConfigFile, a simple alternative to Python 2.7.x's ConfigFileParser.


* Rationale

I configure my customers' boxes using a couple of standard config files. Python's ConfigFileParser
has been fine but does have some limitations: it doesn't preserve comments or blank lines, it forces every option to
have an associated section and is somewhat over-engineered for what I need. So here for your pleasure
is ConfigFile. 


* Features

- Read and write configuration files
- Comments, option=value, single_options, [Section Headers], and blank lines recognised
- Comments and blank lines are detected and preserved when writing back to disk
- The top section of the file does not need a section header
- Blank config files may be created in memory and written to disk if required
- Sections and options may be freely added, removed or changed
- Uses the same regexes as ConfigFileParser
- Everything is a string - because everything in a text file is a
  string. Conversion to sensible values is up to you.


* Example config file

    # This is a comment (comment character can be changed to other characters per config file)

    # Top options do not need a section header and go into a special section called topsection
    first_option
    another_option

    [First_section]

    # An important comment that will be preserved when saving the file

    player = mplayer
    skip = True
    boot_order=SSD,USB,internal

    # Section headers can contain spaces
    [Second section]

    startx = true
    shutdown_early
